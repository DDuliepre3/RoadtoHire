            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p title="Description">The Charlotte Hornets are an <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr> team centered in North Carolina. This team is part of the Eastern Conference SouthEast Division. Considered one of the worst franchises in the league, the Hornets are owned by NBA legend Michael Jordan since 2010.</p>
                <p title="History">The initial Hornets franchise started in 1988, but was then relocated to New Orleans in 2002. This encouraged a new expansion team which was called the Charlotte Bobcats. <em>That was a <b>DARK</b> time for the city of Charlotte.</em> New Orleans rebranded their NBA team to the Pelicans, reopening the opportunity for the Hornets name to return to the Queen City. By the start of the 2014-15 NBA season, the Bobcats were officially renamed the Charlotte Hornets.</p>

            <h2>So What's Wrong??</h2>
                <p>Well besides our light in the darkness in 2x All Star Kemba Walker, the Hornets have been in a deep hole for an extremely long time. The team just hasn't been superb in competing with other opponents. The coaching staff hasn't been the best, and the scouting team isn't A1. Charlotte's General Manager in Cho cannot draft future stars for their association, and it is easily seen in their win-loss record. There is no depth in the line-up and it continues to fatigue the starting five. So there needs to be a change...</p>

            <h2>Hope</h2>
                <p>The biggest thing that attracts many Hornets fans is their PG in Kemba Walker. Born in the Bronx and drafted in 2011 by Charlotte, Kemba has enticed himself as the heart and soul of the team for the past 7 years. He is an aggressive type of player that only stands at 6 ft. 1 in. Kemba's basketball career highlights include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>2x NBA All-Star</li>
                        <li>2x NBA Sportsmanship Award</li>
                        <li><abbr title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</abbr> Championship</li>
                        <li>NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player</li>
                        <li>Bob Cousy Award</li>
                        <li>McDonald's All-American</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Out of all the downs in Charlotte's team history, this spirited individual always wears a smile on his face. He does everything he can each and every game to will his team to a victory. The Hornets would be nowhere close to where they are now without Number 15. The only knock Kemba has is that he cannot lead this team to a championship by himself, especially in today's NBA.</p>
