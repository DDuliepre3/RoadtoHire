        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <h3>Team Needs</h3>
            <p>The Hornets have a lot of things to improve on this Summer 2018. First, they need to look towards <b>young talent</b>. The future of the Hornets should start with young players with high potential that would be able to improve over time. The team also needs better <b>three-point shooters</b>. After trading Marco Belinelli away, the Hornets production on deep buckets have gone down significantly. This is forcing the players to take an unneeded amount of threes. Bringing this to the next point of emphasis which is <b>better shot selection</b>. It is really self explanatory. They need to take better shots and not force up difficult and contested shots. The last thing the Hornets should focus on during this free agency is <b>finding another star</b>. Mentioned before, Kemba can't do it alone. He needs some help, and free agency is the best way of acquiring this last piece.</p>
        <h3>Free Agency Prospecting</h3>
            <p>The Charlotte Hornets need a combination of cheap, young, 3PT Specialist, and star all in one person. Finding this piece to play alongside Kemba should help the Hornets' future immensely.</p>
