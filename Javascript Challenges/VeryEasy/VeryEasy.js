// VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a number to each. Console log the difference between the numbers.
// Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”

var firstNum = prompt('choose a number');
var secondNum = prompt('choose another number');
var difference = secondNum - firstNum;

console.log('The difference between ' + secondNum + ' and ' + firstNum + ' is ' + difference);
